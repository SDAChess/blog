#+SUMMARY: We configure a DHCP server after having spoofed the mac address of a wifi hotspot.

In my school, the network is managed by an entity called the *lacoB*[fn:1]. The lacoB
is usually a bit slow to setup things and there is a lot of bureaucracy involved
to get the tiniest thing done. It has been several month since *L'Atelier*
(which I am a part of) has asked the lacoB through the usual channels to install
an ethernet connection so that we could connect our computers to the network.
But we are still waiting for an answer. That's when I decided to take matters
into my own hands.

You see, we have these Wifi hotspots that are installed and are linked and
powered through *POE*. So, we have an ethernet cable, connected to some sort of
network, so an idea sprout in my head. What if I just used that ethernet cable
to connect to my computer or some kind of switch? Then I would be able to access
the Internet. But that would be too easy.

* Going around MAC filtering
The first obstacle that I encountered was to be able to get an IP from the
network. It seems that the wifi hotspot where MAC filtered meaning that you
could not get an IP, redering use the of the network impossible. The idea behind
MAC filtering is that since every device/network card have a single MAC address,
allowing only known MAC addresses to connect to the network is supposed to
increase security. But, MAC addresses can be spoofed and since most wifi
hotspot MAC addresses are written just on the back of the hotspot, that wasn't
too hard to find. We had the MAC address of the Wifi hotspot, now we try to
connect to the network by spoofing our own MAC address with the one of the hotspot.

Throughout this article we will use `systemd-networkd` to configure the network
interfaces. Our system is composed of three ethernet ports: `enp3s0` that is
directly connected to the wifi hotspot ethernet cable. `enp6s0f1` that is
connected to our ethernet switch. First thing is to configure `enp3s0` for MAC
spoofing using this piece of configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC
[Match]
Name=enp3s0

[Network]
DHCP=true

[Link]
MACAddress=f4:ea:b5:90:00:80
NamePolicy=kernel database onboard slot path
#+END_SRC

After having restarted the network service, we now have internet and an IP address!

[fn:1] The name is kept secret to avoid any futher litigations, but the sharpest
knifes in the kitchen would get it.
